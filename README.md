# MyHeroMyFather
The website is one of my first creations during my first year of college. The lecturer assigned us to build a website about someone that inspired our life, that we consider a **hero**.
I choose to make my website about my father.

Since I will post the site online, I changed the text to lorem ipsum.

## site-map

The site is divided in 7 pages.
- homepage
- myFather's
